Privacy Policy 

 

We respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information that Schoolishness, 
LLC (“We” or “Schoolishness”) collects from you when you visit our website at www.tribuneymca.com 
as well as information that is collected through use of the Schoolishness service (collectively, the 
“Service”) by customers (“Clients”). It also describes how we use that information and under what 
circumstances we disclose it. 


1. Choice of Law. This Agreement is exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, 
the laws of the State of Illinois, United States of America, without regard to the conflict of laws 
provisions thereof to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of 
the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Illinois. 
2. Information Collected. When you use our Service or visit our website, we may receive and 
collect certain information. The information that we may receive and collect depends on what 
you do when you use our Service. 
a. Information Actively Submitted to Schoolishness. For most of the browsing on our 
Service, we neither require nor collect “User Information.” User Information is 
information that could personally identify you, for example, your name, address, phone 
number, e-mail address, and credit card information. User Information may also include 
such information as demographic information when linked to User Information such as 
your name or e-mail address. You can browse our website and take as much time as you 
want to review our services without having to submit such User Information. 
We do, however, need you to actively submit User Information when: (1) you want to 
contact us via electronic means or Service submission; (2) you enter a contest or 
sweepstakes, if one is available; (3) you join our email lists; or (4) you wish to open an 
account on the Service. Schoolishness uses this collected information for purposes such 
as processing and fulfilling orders, billing, service improvement, and research. 
Please note that E-mail or other forms of electronic communication, including Service 
submissions, are not secure and/or confidential means of communication. 
b. Information Collected Automatically When Visiting Our Service. Some information 
may be automatically received and collected from you when you visit our Service 
through the use of web beacons and cookies. This information may include some or all 
of the following items: the name of the domain and host from which you access the 
Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using and 
the IP address of your Internet Service Provider; the type and version of Internet browser 
software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site, the 
length of your stay and the specific pages, images, video or forms that you access while 
visiting the site; the Internet address of the Service from which you linked directly to our 
Service, and if applicable, the search engine that referred you and any search strings or 
phrases that you entered into the search engine to find this site; and demographic 
information concerning the country of origin of your computer and the language(s) used 
by it. We use this information to monitor the usage of our Service, assess and improve its 
performance, ensure technological compatibility with your computer/device, and 
understand the relative importance of the information provided on our Service. We may 
also use this data to conduct statistical analyses on visitors’ usage patterns and other 





aggregated data. 
i. Information Collected via Cookies. “Cookies” are small files or records that 
are placed on your computer’s hard drive to distinguish you from other visitors to 
our Service. The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites and 
service providers to collect or track information about your activities. 
A cookie may enable a website owner to track how a visitor navigates through its 
site and the areas in which they show interest. This is similar to a traffic report: it 
tracks trends and behaviors, but does not identify individuals. Information 
gathered may include date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent at the 
site/application, and the website visited just before and just after a visit to our 
Service. 
Cookies can be set to expire: (1) on a specified date; (2) after a specific period of 
time; (3) when a transaction has been completed; or (4) when a user turns off 
his/her Internet browser. A cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor’s 
Internet browser closes is called a “session” cookie. Cookies that expire based 
on a time set by the web server are called “persistent” cookies. 
Our Service may use both “session cookies” and “persistent cookies.” We may 
use “session” cookies to track your log-in status if you are logged into the 
Service. We may use “persistent cookies” to determine what ID you last logged 
in under and which site referred you to our Service. Most people do not know 
that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit our Service or 
most Services because browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can 
choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or 
you can turn off cookie placements. If you refuse cookies, there may be parts of 
our Service that may not function properly. 






 

ii. Information Collected Via Web Beacons. Web Beacons are clear images, 
often GIF files, that recognize information on computers (including cookies) 
when viewing particular pages associated with the beacon. Web Beacons used 
alone or in conjunction with cookies provide Schoolishness with information 
about Client and visitor usage of the website and Service. They also provide 
Schoolishness with information about how recipients of Schoolishness e-mails 
interact with the Service (e.g., such as whether an e-mail recipient clicked on a 
link which sent him to a page on our website). 
In addition, like many service providers, we are partnered with a third-party ad 
server who manages advertising for Schoolishness on other sites and services. 
This server utilizes web beacons and cookies to collect non-personally 
identifiable information about your use of our Service, as well as other services 
and websites. The purpose is to provide you with targeted advertising that is 
geared specifically toward your interests. This paragraph does not currently 
apply because we are not collecting information or showing advertising at this 
time. We will provide an opt out option if we should begincollecting such 
information 






 

c. Information Submitted to the Schoolishness Service by Client. 





i. We collect information for our Clients. If you are attempting to amend, remove, 
modify, or access personal, User Information, or other information submitted to 
the Schoolishness Service by a Client, please direct your query to the Client, who 
is able to address your requests directly without Schoolishness’ intervention or 
involvement. If a Client requests that Schoolishness remove or otherwise amend 
any data, Schoolishness will respond to the Client’s request within 30 business 
days. 
ii. We retain User Information and other personal data submitted by our Clients for 
as long needed to provide services to said Clients pursuant to their agreements 
with Schoolishness, including this Policy. In addition, Schoolishness will retain 
such information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, enforce 
contracts, and resolve disputes. Schoolishness has no direct relationship with 
individuals whose data is processed through the Service. 




3. Linking to Third-Party Service. When you click on links through our Service that takes you to 
third-party websites or platforms, you will be subject to the third parties’ privacy policies. While 
we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, we cannot be responsible for the actions of 
any third-party services. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policies of any and every 
website you visit, whether you are linking from our Service or browsing on your own. 
4. Security. We strive to ensure that the personal or User Information you share with use is handled 
in a safe, secure and responsible manner. We have contracted with service providers who have 
security measures to help protect against loss, unauthorized access and alteration of the 
information in our control. We will only disclose such Information to employees and authorized 
service providers who require such information for the purposes described in this Policy. The 
databases of our service providers are protected by physical, technical, and procedural measures 
that restrict access to authorized persons in accordance with this Policy. 
Although no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure, and we cannot 
ensure against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of data, we 
take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. 
5. Marketing & Sharing of Submitted Information. Our view on using User Information is 
simple. We do not rent or sell your personal or User Information (collectively, “Information”). 
We may, however, use such information that you actively submit to better assist you when you 
visit or contact us again and to send you special offers that may be of interest to you. 
We do this by general marketing communications for our services via e-mail, (collectively, 
“Marketing Communications”). Unless you “opt-out” through opportunities available to you 
through our Marketing Communications, we may send you Marketing Communications. You 
may also “opt-out” of future Marketing Communications by following the instructions provided 
in this Privacy Policy under the “Access to and Managing Your Information” section of this 
Privacy Policy. 
Except where we otherwise obtain your express permission, we share your Information with third 
parties only under the limited circumstances stated below: 


 

a. Information is subject to disclosure in response to judicial or other governmental 
subpoenas, warrants and court orders served on us in accordance with their terms, as 
otherwise required by applicable law, or in response to requests by law enforcement; 





b. Information is subject to disclosure to protect our rights or property, protect its legitimate 
business interests, to enforce the provisions of our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, 
and/or to prevent harm to you or others; 
c. Information may be disclosed to carefully selected third-party service providers in order 
to provide services to you and to Schoolishness, such as to provide customer service; 
send or email Marketing Communications; maintain our customer loyalty program and 
database and other programs; monitor the activity of our Service; conduct surveys; and 
administer contests or sweepstakes. We will share your Information with our carefully 
selected third-party services providers on a confidential basis. These service providers 
are prohibited from using your Information for any purpose other than providing our 
services. 
d. If Schoolishness is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its 
assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any 
change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you 
may have regarding your personal information. 


6. Access to and Managing Your Information. We believe it is important for you to be able to: 
(1) find out what Information you have provided to us through our Service or Service; (2) update 
your Information; and (3) “opt out” of receiving future Marketing Communications. To inquire 
about your Information, update your Information, or “opt” out of receiving future Marketing 
Communications, please do one of the following: 


 

a. Access your user account through the Service and make necessary changes there 
b. Send an email with your contact information and request to admin@schoolishness.com 
c. If you send an e-mail request, please be sure to include your full name, address, phone 
number and e-mail address and indicate the specific nature of your request. If you want 
to “opt in” or “opt out” of receiving Marketing Communications, specifically what type 
of Marketing Communication (e.g., e-mail or direct mail) you wish to receive or stop 
receiving. This will ensure we identify you correctly in our systems and accurately 
process your request. We will take appropriate steps to implement your request, but due 
to production, mailing and system timelines, it may take up to: 30 business days for e-
mails. Until that change takes effect, you may still receive or not receive Marketing 
Communications from us. Note that you cannot opt out of account or service-related 
messages sent by Schoolishness – they are integral to performance of the Services. 




 

 

7. Changes to Privacy Policies. Our Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time at our 
sole discretion, so we suggest that you review the current Privacy Policy regularly. If we adapt 
any changes to our Privacy Policy, we will provide notice by posting a link in a highly-visible 
portion of the Service alerting Users to this fact. 
For Clients and Information Collected From Them and By Them: We will use Information in 
accordance with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time which your license(s) to the Service 
began. Our updated Privacy Policy will take effect upon renewal of your license(s).

accordance with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time during which the Information was

8. Tracking & Do Not Track. 
a. Do Not Track Signals. Web browsers or mobile applications may enable you to use a 
“do not track” feature, which appends a header to all requests for information from your

“Do Not Track” requests by your browser/applications, and our practices are not altered 
by your use of such.

advertising. 
d. Third Party Ads. Third parties will not be able to collect information about specific users

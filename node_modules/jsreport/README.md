# jsreport

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsreport/jsreport.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsreport/jsreport)

**Open source platform for designing and rendering various reports.**

jsreport lets developers to define reports using  javascript templating engines (like jsrender or handlebars) and print them into pdf using [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org) or [fop](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/). For more informations about the platform please visit http://jsreport.net

## Production installation
see [http://jsreport.net/downloads](http://jsreport.net/downloads)

## Development
To be able to install and start jsreport on your development machine you need to do following.

1. install nodejs
2. clone this repository
3. npm install
4. npm start

You may find installation troubleshooting guide specific for your platform [here](https://github.com/jsreport/docs/tree/master/installation).

See [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) for build automation options.

###Environemnts
jsreport adapts to `production` and `development` nodejs environments. Difference is that in `production` environment you get javascript files combined and minified for fast web application startup opposite to `development` environment where you get all js files individually what makes debugging easier. Second difference is that in `production` environment jsreport use `prod.config.json` as configuration file opposite to `dev.config.json` in `development.

To change environment use cmd `set NODE_ENV=development` or use options your IDE provides. If you don't specify node environment jsreport assumes production as default.

###Configurations
jsreport loads `dev.config.json` or `prod.config.json` configuration file on start up based on nodejs environment. If configuration file is not found, jsreport creates default configuration file from `example.config.json`.

See [config](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/blob/master/config.md) documentation for details.

###Tests

 **grunt test** - start tests with file system based db (neDb), no mongo needed

 **grunt test-mongo** - start tests with mongo db, mongodb must be running on localhost

 **grunt test-all** - start tests with nedb and then once again with mongo (used with travis CI)

 **grunt test-integration** - start all tests with nedb including integration tests,  needs java, fop and phantomjs running

## Contributions
The easiest way how to contribute to jsreport open source community is to implement jsreport extension. Pull requests to this core repository are also welcome.

##Roadmap

**JANUARY**
- Documentation/Examples - we are preparing set of tutorials for more advanced fearures like embedding, scheduling or sending reports in emails
- Security - jsreport will get user management with delegated permissions and public templates sharing

**FEBRUARY**
- Huge refactoring - splitting jsreport into multiple npm packages, improving code quality

**FURTHER PLANS**
- java sdk
- add jsreport to amazon, google and microsoft cloud stores
- reports directly from databases
- Missing a feature? Submit a feature request.
